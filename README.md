PasswordGenerator
=================

Generate passwords that can be quickly typed by using alternate hands on the QWERTY keyboard for each letter of the password or by restricting the letters of the password to either the left hand or the right hand. Alternatively, the password can be numeric only. A punctuation character can be added on the end to make the password more difficult to guess.

All passwords generated are upper-case only because the goal of these passwords are to be quickly typed.

Written many years ago when not all devices were constantly connected to the intenet and massive password databases could not be used to hack into systems. These days, it's advised to use long password phrases, mixing upper and lower case, punctuation, and other techniques.
